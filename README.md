Overview
This application allows users to convert image files into different formats using a web interface. Users can upload an image and select the desired output format (PNG, JPEG, GIF). The application is built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

Libraries Required
To run this application, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
Pillow: A Python Imaging Library that adds image processing capabilities.
Installation
You can install all the required libraries at once using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

pip install Flask Pillow

Alternatively, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

Flask Pillow

Then, install the libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Code Explanation
Backend (app.py)
Flask Initialization: The application is created by initializing a Flask instance.

app = Flask(name)

Configuration: The upload folder is defined, and allowed file extensions are specified.

app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads/' app.config['ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS'] = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}

Allowed File Check: A helper function checks if the uploaded file has an allowed extension.

def allowed_file(filename): return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in app.config['ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS']

Routes:

Index Route: Displays the main upload form.

@app.route('/') def index(): return render_template('index.html')

Upload Route: Handles file uploads and image conversion.

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST']) def upload_file(): # Logic to handle file uploads and convert the image

Image Conversion: The function convert_image takes the input image path and the desired output format, then saves the converted image.

def convert_image(input_path, output_format): image = Image.open(input_path) output_filename = input_path.rsplit('.', 1)[0] + '.' + output_format image.save(output_filename, format=output_format.upper()) return output_filename

Frontend (index.html)
HTML Structure: The HTML file contains a form for users to upload an image and select the desired output format.

CSS Styling: Simple CSS styles are applied to make the interface more appealing, with a responsive layout and hover effects on buttons.

Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

python app.py

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the image converter.

Usage
Upload an image file by clicking on the "Choose File" button.
Select the desired output format from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Convert" button to process the image. The converted file will be downloaded automatically.
